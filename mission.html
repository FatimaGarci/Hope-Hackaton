    <p class="para">
        We are at a critical point. There is a public health emergency from air pollution and a global climate
        crisis.
        In today’s world, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition is more needed than ever.

        Our vision is an atmosphere that enables people and the planet to thrive – a stabilized climate with warming
        limited to 1.5ºC and drastically reduced air pollution.

        In the next decade we will work to put the world on a pathway that rapidly reduces warming in the near-term
        and
        maximizes development, health, environmental and food security benefits.

            </h1>
            <p>Short-lived climate pollutants - including black carbon, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and tropospheric
                ozone – are powerful climate forcers with global warming potentials many times that of carbon dioxide.
                They also significantly impact food, water and economic security for large populations throughout the
                world, both directly through their negative effects on public health, agriculture and ecosystems, and
                indirectly through their impact on the climate.<br>

                The relatively short atmospheric lifetime of short-lived climate pollutants, combined with their strong
                warming potential, means that strategies to reduce emissions can deliver climate and development
                benefits within a matter of decades.<br>

                The United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) have identified a
                package of control measures to reduce short-lived climate pollutants that can achieve 90% of total
                potential emissions reductions for black carbon, methane and HFCs. Many of these measures involve
                cost-effective technologies and practices that already exist.<br>

                If quickly implemented, these measures can cut the amount of warming that would occur over the next few
                decades by as much as 0.6°C, while avoiding 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution
                annually by 2030, and preventing 52 million tonnes of crop losses per year.</p>

            </h1>
            <p> It is the deadliest form of pollution, killing millions of people each year, according to a new
                study. The Cost of Air Pollution, a joint report by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics
                and
                Evaluation (IHME), also highlights the economic toll, showing that premature deaths linked to air
                pollution cost the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars in lost labour income. 92%
                More than nine out of 10 of the world’s population – 92% – lives in places where air pollution exceeds
                safe limits, according to research from the World Health Organization (WHO).<br>

                Air pollution is the fourth-largest threat to human health, behind high blood pressure, dietary risks
                and smoking. The health risks of breathing dirty air include respiratory infections and cardiovascular
                diseases,
                stroke, chronic lung disease and lung cancer. 6.5 million
                There were an estimated 6.5 million deaths worldwide from air pollution-related diseases in 2012, WHO
                data shows. That’s 11.6% of all global deaths – more than the number of people killed by HIV/AIDS,
                tuberculosis and road injuries combined.<br>

                Almost all deaths (94%) linked to air pollution occur in low- and middle-income countries, the WHO
                says. Parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, India, China and the Middle East are the biggest regional danger
                spots. More than 1 million air pollution-related deaths occurred in China and over 600,000 in India in
                2012,
                according to the WHO. But the worst countries for deaths per head of population are in Eastern Europe.
                Ukraine, at the top of the table, had 120 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012.<br>

                The study by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) calculated the
                economic cost of air pollution. It found that air pollution led to one in 10 deaths in 2013, which cost
                the global economy about $225 billion in lost labour income. Tiny particles, known as PM2.5, have a
                diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and can penetrate deep into
                the lungs and cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of disease.

                Air Pollution Control Technology Series Training Tool
                The control technology series is a self instructional training tool that is designed to provide a basic
                overview to those unfamiliar with a variety of air pollution control technologies. The series is broken
                down into different types of equipment such as: wet scrubbers, carbon absorption, incineration,
                condensation, and electrostatic precipitators.<br>

                Air Toxics Community Assessment and Risk Reduction Projects Database
                This database has been compiled to provide a resource of planned, completed, and ongoing community level
                air toxics assessments across the country. By sharing information about efforts at the local level to
                measure, understand, and address air toxics emissions, this database will help ensure that communities
                designing and implementing their own assessments will be able to build upon past efforts and lessons
                learned.<br>

                Air Toxics Risk Assessment (ATRA) Reference Library
                EPA is developing an ATRA reference library for conducting air toxics analyses at the facility and
                community-scale. This library provides information on the fundamental principles of risk-based
                assessment for air toxics and how to apply those principles in different settings as well as strategies
                for reducing risk at the local level.<br>
